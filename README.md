Visualise the CSV data using the appropriate a graph(s) in a way that a user can filter between different countries, and regions.

I am using a Vega-Lite editor to create my visualisation and this code will be contained in the HTML file.

I have uploaded the source code for my visualisation. I have used the Vega Lite platform to complete my visualisation and have included this in the adapt.html file. When this file is opened, the visualisation should appear on the webpage.

I chose to visualise the data on a yearly basis and the best way to do this was with small multiples. I created a multiple for each year of the data and this enables a very easy comparison between each year. The tooltip that I included allows the user to hover over a particular country and the corresponding CPI score will be displayed. The user can then easily scroll down and compare the years simultaneously.
